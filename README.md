## Hardware Requirements
* Raspberry Pi
* Raspberry Pi camera
* SPIN [spin.media.mit.edu](http://spin.media.mit.edu)


## Setup
* Set up your Pi with the standard Raspian image. I hooked up a touchscreen I had handy, but this will work just the same with a mouse and keyboard.
* Use the Setup program to enable the Pi Camera. 
* Use whatever setup you need to attach/rig/aim the camera. If you are in need of something, you can buy Pi Camera holders from Pimoroni or Adafruit or find files to 3D Print or Lasercut on multiple sites including thingiverse.com
* Place spincontrol.py in your documents folder.
* Create a spinTemp folder in your documents folder
* Create a SpinGifs folder on your desktop (this is where your final objects will go).
* Either start spincontrol.py from IDLE3 or from the command line: python3 spincontrol.py
* It should just work!
